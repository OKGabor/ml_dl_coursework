## Assignment 1: ABC Analysis
**File:** `Assignment1_ABC.ipynb`

### Description
This assignment focuses on **Customer Churn Analysis**, and covers the process from data wrangling and EDA to modeling and interpretation of the results.

### Techniques and Models Used
- **Data Wrangling:** Data cleaning and feature engineering for modeling.
- **EDA:** Business and customer understanding.
- **Customer Value Modeling:** Linear Regression; Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net Regression; Feature Rmportance.
- **Churn Analysis:** SMOTE; Logistic Regression; Decision Tree; XGBoost; Confusion Matrix.
- **Interpretation:** Insights and recommendations for company management based on the analysis and modeling, briding the gap between data science and business.

## Assignment 2: FarTrend Analysis
**File:** `Assignment2_FarTrend.ipynb`

### Description
This assignment aims at **Purchase Analysis** for an e-commerce company. The goal is to understand customer behaviour and provide data-driven actionable insights.

### Techniques and Models Used
- **Data Wrangling:** Data cleaning and feature engineering for modeling; Isolation Forest to handle outliers.
- **EDA:** Business and customer understanding.
- **Client Segmantation:** k-means; Silhoutte-score; PCA; Hierarchical Clustering; Cluster Characteristics.
- **Recommendation System:** Recommendation system based on similar products.
- **Interpretation:** Insights and recommendations for company management based on the analysis and modeling, briding the gap between data science and business.

## Assignment 3: Photo Classifier
**File:** `Assignment3.ipynb`

### Description
This assignment involves building a **deep learning model** to classify business photos into categories such as Food, Drink, Interior, and Exterior. The dataset is sourced from Yelp, which contains tens of millions of photos uploaded by users.

### Techniques and Models Used
- **Deep Learning:** Using TensorFlow and Keras to build neural networks.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Implementing CNNs for image classification.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizing dataset and model performance.
- **Business Problem Tackled:** Developing a photo understanding system to create semantic data about individual photographs, enhancing the user experience on platforms like Yelp.

## Assignment 4: TBD
**File:** `Assignment4.ipynb`

### Description
The fourth assignment is yet to be completed and will be updated in due course. It will cover advanced topics in machine learning and their business applications.

### Techniques and Models Used
- **To be determined.**
